# Car Make Recognition  

This repository contains a project developed as part of the **Machine Learning** course at the *Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Information Technology Osijek (FERIT)*.  

The main objective of the project was to build a model capable of **recognizing the make of a car from its image**.  

---

## Project Description  
- The project applies **machine learning techniques** to classify car images by their make.  
- A dataset from Kaggle was used to train and test the model:  
  [Cars Image Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kshitij192/cars-image-dataset)  
- The model was trained to identify different car brands based on visual features extracted from the images.

## Technologies Used  
- **Python** (main programming language)  
- **Machine Learning frameworks** (e.g., TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch – depending on chosen implementation)  
- **NumPy, Pandas** for data handling  
- **OpenCV / Matplotlib** for image preprocessing and visualization

## Purpose  
This project was developed as a **faculty assignment** for the Machine Learning course.  
It demonstrates the application of machine learning methods in solving a real-world image classification problem.
